\section{Basic topological definitions} \label{section-basic-defs}

% TODO: only some defins, ref to def of topology, topological space, etc. 

\textbf{Notation:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Let $Y$ be a topological space with the topology $\T_Y$,
  \item Let $X$ be a metric space with the metric $d_X$ which is also a topological space with the topology induced by its metric,
  \item If $Z_1, Z_2$ are topological spaces then $C(Z_1, Z_2)$ is the set of all continous maps from $Z_1$ to $Z_2$,
  \item Let $y \in Y$ then $\NB_y$ is the set of all neighbourhoods of the element $y$.
  \item Let $\varepsilon \in \R_{>0}$ and let $x \in X$: $B_{\varepsilon}(x) := \{ y\in X \: | \: d_X(x, y) < \varepsilon\}$
\end{enumerate}

\begin{defin}
  A \textbf{path} $\gamma$ in $Y$ is a continuous map $\R \supseteq [0,1] \to Y$.
\end{defin}

\begin{defin}
  Let $\gamma_1, \gamma_2 \in C([0, 1], Y)$. A \textbf{free homotopy} $H: [0,1]^2 \to Y$ between $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ is a continuous map such that:
  \begin{equation*}
    \forall s \in [0,1]: H(s, 0) = \gamma_1(s) \: \land \: H(s, 1) = \gamma_2(s)
  \end{equation*}

  Now let $\gamma_1, \gamma_2 \in C([0, 1], Y)$ such that $\gamma_1(0) = \gamma_2(0) \: \land \: \gamma_1(1) = \gamma_2(1)$ i.e. that paths start and end at the same point.
  The homotopy $H \in C([0,1]^2, Y)$ is called \textbf{endpoint preserving} if it is a free homotopy between $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ and additionally it should have the following property: 
  \begin{equation*}
    \forall t\in[0,1]\forall i\in \{1,2\}: H(0, t) = \gamma_i(0) \: \land \: H(1, t) = \gamma_i(1)
  \end{equation*}

  If a free homotopy $H$ between the two paths $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ exists they are called \textbf{freely homotopic} $\gamma_1 \overset{\cdot}{\sim}_H \gamma_2$.
  If the two paths $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ have the same start and end point and there exists a endpoint preserving homotopy $H$ between them then they are called 
  \textbf{homotopic} $\gamma_1 \sim_H \gamma_2$. If a path is (freely) homotopic to a constant path ($[0,1] \to Y, t \mapsto y \in Y$) then it is called \textbf{null-homotopic}.

  Lastly define the homotpy relation $\sim$ on $C([0,1], Y)$ where 
  \begin{equation*}
    \gamma_1, \gamma_2 \in C([0,1], Y): \gamma_1 \sim \gamma_2 \iff \exists H \text{ homotopy between } \gamma_1 \text{ and } \gamma_2.
  \end{equation*}
\end{defin}

In this thesis all homotopies are endpoint preserving if it is not explicitly stated that they should be free homotopies.

\begin{defin} \label{def:connectedness}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[] % this has to be here because of the newline after the defition label
    \item $Y$ \textbf{connected} $\;\longeq\; \exists A,B \in \T_Y\setminus \{\emptyset\}: A \cap B = \emptyset \: \land \: Y = A \cup B \Rightarrow A = \emptyset \: \lor \: B = \emptyset$
    \item $Y$ \textbf{path-connected} $\;\longeq\; \forall x,y \in Y \exists\gamma \in C([0,1], Y): \gamma(0) = x \: \land \: \gamma(1) = y$
    \item $Y$ \textbf{locally (path-)connected} $\;\longeq\; \forall y \in Y\forall U \in \NB_y\exists V\in \NB_y: V \subseteq U \: \land \: V$ (path-)connected
  \end{itemize}
\end{defin}

The following definitions only work in metric spaces:

\begin{defin}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[] % this has to be here because of the newline after the defition label
    \item $X$ \textbf{uniformly locally path-connected} (u.l.p.c.) $\: \longeq \\ \forall \varepsilon \in \R_{>0} \exists \delta \in \R_{>0}\forall x \in X: \forall x_1, x_2 \in B_{\delta}(x)\exists \gamma \in C([0,1], B_{\varepsilon}(x)): \gamma(0) = x_1 \: \land \: \gamma(1) = x_2$
    \item $X$ \textbf{semi-locally simply connected} (s.l.s.c) $\: \longeq \\ \forall x\in X\exists \varepsilon \in \R_{>0}$: Every loop in $B_{\varepsilon}(x)$ is null-homotopic in $X$
    \item $X$ \textbf{uniformly semi-locally simply connected} (u.s.l.s.c) $\: \longeq \\ \exists \varepsilon \in \R_{>0}\forall x\in X$: Every loop in $B_{\varepsilon}(x)$ is null-homotopic in $X$
  \end{itemize}
  \vspace*{10pt}
  For clarification, the difference between semi-locally simply connectedness and uniformly semi-locally simply connected is 
  that in the first case $\varepsilon$ is choosen dependend on $x$ and in the latter case it is chosen independently for all $x$.
\end{defin}

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:homotopy-equivalence}
  The homotopy relation $\sim$ of paths is an equivalence relation on the set $C([0,1],Y)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Let $\gamma_1, \gamma_2, \gamma_3 \in C([0,1],Y)$ with $\gamma_1(0) = \gamma_2(0) = \gamma_3(0)$ and $\gamma_1(1) = \gamma_2(1) = \gamma_3(1)$.
  
  \textit{Reflexivity:}
  Consinder the homotopy $H: [0,1]^2 \to Y, \: (s, t) \mapsto \gamma_1(s)$. 
  
  It holds that $\forall s\in [0,1]: H(s, 0) = \gamma_1(s),\: H(s, 1) = \gamma_1(s)$. And thus $\gamma_1 \sim_H \gamma_1 \Rightarrow \gamma_1 \sim \gamma_1$.

  \textit{Symmetry:} 
  Assume that $\gamma_1 \sim \gamma_2$. This means there exists a homotopy $H$ such that $\gamma_1 \sim_H \gamma_2$. 
  Now define the homotopy $F: [0,1]^2 \to Y, \: (s, t) \mapsto H(s, 1-t)$. 
  
  From this definition it follows that $\forall s \in [0,1]:$
  \begin{align*}
    F(s, 0) &= H(s, 1 - 0) = \gamma_2(s) \\
    F(s, 1) &= H(s, 1 - 1) = \gamma_1(s)
  \end{align*}
  and hence $\gamma_2 \sim_F \gamma_1 \Rightarrow \gamma_2 \sim \gamma_1$.

  \textit{Transitivity:}
  Assume that $\gamma_1 \sim \gamma_2$ and $\gamma_2 \sim \gamma_3$. Let $H$ be a homotopy between $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ and let $F$ be a homotopy between $\gamma_2$ and $\gamma_3$. 
  Define the homotopy
  \begin{equation*} 
    G: [0,1]^2 \to Y, \: (s,t) \mapsto \begin{cases}
      H(s, 2t), &t \in [0, {1 \over 2}], \\
      F(s, 2t - 1), &t \in [{1 \over 2}, 1].
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}

  Then the following equations hold:
  \begin{align*}
    G(s,0) &= H(s,0) = \gamma_1(s), \\
    G\left(s,{1 \over 2}\right) &= H(s, 1) = \gamma_2(s) = F(s, 0), \\
    G(s, 1) &= F(s, 1) = \gamma_3(s).
  \end{align*}
  and thus $\gamma_1 \sim_G \gamma_3 \Rightarrow \gamma_1 \sim \gamma_3$.
\end{proof}

\begin{rem} \label{rem:reparam}
  Let $\alpha: [0,1] \to [0,1]$ be a continuous map with $\alpha(0) = 0, \alpha(1) = 1$ and let $\gamma \in C([0,1], Y)$. Then it follows that $\gamma \sim \gamma \circ \alpha$.
\end{rem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $F: [0,1]^2 \to Y, (s, t) \mapsto \gamma((1 - t)s + t\alpha(s))$.

  At first fix $s \in [0,1]$ then $s, \alpha(s) \in [0,1]$ and $(1 - t)s + t\alpha(s)$ is a convex combination of the two points. 
  $[0,1]$ is a convex set and thus $\forall t\in[0,1]: (1 - t)s + t\alpha(s) \in [0,1]$. Because of the continuity of the operations $+$ and $\cdot$ in $[0,1]$ 
  and the continuity of $\alpha$ the map $F$ is continuous and the following hold:
  \begin{align*}
    F(s, 0) &= \gamma(s), \\
    F(s, 1) &= \gamma(\alpha(s)),
  \end{align*}
  and thus $F$ is a homotopy between $\gamma \sim \gamma \circ \alpha$.
\end{proof}

\begin{defin}
  Let $y_0 \in Y$. The \textbf{fundamental group} of the topological space $Y$ with basepoint $y_0$ is defined as follows:
  \begin{equation*}
    \pi_1(Y, y_0) := (\{\gamma \in C([0,1],Y) \: | \: \gamma(0) = \gamma(1) = y_0\}/_{\sim}, \: *)
  \end{equation*}
  where 
  \begin{equation*} 
    *: C([0,1], Y) \times C([0,1], Y) \to C([0,1], Y), (\gamma_1, \gamma_2) \mapsto \left(t \mapsto \begin{cases}
    \gamma_1(2t),   &t \in [0, {1 \over 2}], \\
    \gamma_2(2t-1), &t \in [{1 \over 2}, 1],
  \end{cases}\right)
\end{equation*}
is the concatenation of paths. The case $t = {1\over2}$ is included in both cases because the operation is only defined for pahts $\gamma_1, \gamma_2$ if $\gamma_1(1) = \gamma_2(0)$. 
In the case of the fundamental group this is fulfilled for every path because all paths are loops that start and end at the same basepoint.

The operation $*: \pi_1(Y, y_0) \times \pi_1(Y, y_0) \to \pi_1(Y, y_0)$ is defined as follows:
\begin{equation*}
  ([\gamma_1]_{\sim}, [\gamma_2]_{\sim}) \mapsto [\gamma_1]_{\sim} * [\gamma_2]_{\sim} = [\gamma_1 * \gamma_2]_{\sim}
\end{equation*} 
\end{defin}

\begin{thm}
  Let $y_0 \in Y$. The fundamental group $\pi_1(Y, y_0)$ is a well-defined group. 
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  By lemma \ref{lem:homotopy-equivalence} $\sim$ is a well-defined equivalence relation and thus the quotient in the definition is well-defined and the set of loops based at $y_0$ is decomposed into equivalence classes.
  Thus it remains to be shown that the set of equivalence classes of loops up to homotopy together with the concatenation operation $*$ fulfills the group axioms.

  Therefore let $\gamma_1, \gamma_2$ be loops in $Y$ based at $y_0 \in Y$. From the definition of $*$ it is clear that $\gamma_1 * \gamma_2$ is again a loop in $Y$ based at $y_0$.
  Now let $\tilde{\gamma_1}$ be another loop based at $y_0$ that is homotopic to $\gamma_1$ via the homotopy $H$. Define $F: [0,1]^2 \to Y$ as follows:
  \begin{equation*}
    (s, t) \mapsto \begin{cases}
      H(2s, t), &s \in [0,{1 \over 2}], \\
      \gamma_2(s), &s \in [{1 \over 2}, 1].
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
  This is a well-defined homotopy between $\gamma_1 * \gamma_2$ and $\tilde{\gamma_1} * \gamma_2$ because of:
  \begin{align*}
    F(s, 0) &= \gamma_1 * \gamma_2, \\
    F(s, 1) &= \tilde{\gamma_1} * \gamma_2,
  \end{align*}
  
  There is no problem for $t = {1 \over 2}$ because the homotopy is endpoint preserving. Thus it holds that $\gamma_1 \sim \tilde{\gamma_1} \Rightarrow \gamma_1 * \gamma_2 \sim \tilde{\gamma_1} * \gamma_2$.
  And a similiar argument shows $\gamma_1 \sim \tilde{\gamma_1} \Rightarrow \gamma_2 * \gamma_1 \sim  \gamma_2 * \tilde{\gamma_1}$. 
  This proofs that the group operations is not dependend on the choice of representative of the particular equivalence class which means that the group operation is well-defined.

  Now let $\gamma_3$ be another loop in $Y$ based at $y_0$. 

  Consider the map $\alpha: [0,1] \to [0,1]$ which is defined as:
  \begin{equation*}
    t \mapsto \begin{cases}
      2t, &t \in [0, {1 \over 4}], \\
      t + {1 \over 4}, &t \in [{1\over4}, {1\over2}], \\
      {1\over2}t + {1\over2}, &t\in[{1\over2}, 1],
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
  then $\alpha(0) = 0, \alpha(1) = 1$ and $((\gamma_1 * \gamma_2) * \gamma_3) \circ \alpha = \gamma_1 * (\gamma_2 * \gamma_3)$ and thus $(\gamma_1 * \gamma_2) * \gamma_3 \sim \gamma_1 * (\gamma_2 * \gamma_3)$ by Remark \ref{rem:reparam}.
  Hence the operation $*$ is associative.
  

  Next consider the constant path $e_{y_0}: [0,1] \to Y, \: t \mapsto y_0$ at $y_0$. 
  
  \vspace*{5pt}
  Define $\alpha_1: [0,1] \to [0,1], \: t \mapsto \begin{cases}
    0, &t\in[0, {1\over2}],\\
    2t, &t\in[{1\over2}, 1],
  \end{cases}$ and $\alpha_2: [0,1]\to [0,1], \: t \mapsto \begin{cases}
    2t, &t\in[0, {1\over2}],\\
    0, &t\in[{1\over2}, 1],
  \end{cases}$
  \vspace*{5pt}
  with $\alpha_1(0) = \alpha_2(0) = 0$ and $\alpha_1(1) = \alpha_2(1) = 1$.

  It follows for a loop $\gamma$ in $Y$ based at $y_0$ that: $e_{y_0} * \gamma = \gamma \circ \alpha_1$ and $\gamma * e_{y_0} = \gamma \circ \alpha_2$ and thus by Remark \ref{rem:reparam}:
  \begin{equation*}
    \gamma * e_{y_0} \sim \gamma \sim e_{y_0} * \gamma
  \end{equation*}
  This means that $e_{y_0}$ is the identity element with respect to $*$.

  Now let $\gamma^-$ be a loop in $Y$ based at $y_0$ with $\forall t \in [0,1]: \gamma^-(t) = \gamma(1 - t)$ and consider the homotopy $G: [0,1]^2 \to Y$ with 
  \begin{equation*}
    (s, t) \mapsto \begin{cases}
      \gamma(2s(1-t)), &t \in [0, {1\over2}], \\
      \gamma(2(1-s)(1-t)), &t \in [{1\over2}, 1] 
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
  is a homotopy between $\gamma * \gamma^-$ and $e_{y_0}$ which means $[\gamma] * [\gamma^-] = [\gamma * \gamma^-] = [e_{y_0}]$ and thus $[\gamma^-] = [\gamma]^{-1}$. 
\end{proof}

\section{Discretization of the fundamental group}

The notion of the fundamental group introduced in the previous chapter is very a useful tool for detemining if two topological spaces are \textbf{not} homeomorphic.
The fundamental group has this ability because it is a functor from the category of topological spaces with a fixed basepoint to the category of groups. 
And if the images of a functor are not isomorphic than the arguments that mapped to these images can not be isomorphic in their category because functors preserve isomorphims.

A major disadvantage of the fundamental group is that it is very computationally difficult to calculate.
Thats the reason why there exist many other branches of algebraic topology concerned with other topological invariants that are invariant under homeomorphisms. 
Another fruitful idea would be to reduce the difficulty in calculating the fundamental group by approximating it via discrete fundamental groups. 
This concept it explored further in the following chapter.

% TODO: illustration theta path
\begin{defin}
  Let $\theta \in \R_{>0}$ and $n \in \N$. A \textbf{discrete path} is a map $Z: \R \supseteq [n] \to X$ that is $\theta$-lipschitz, i.e. for $\forall n_1, n_2 \in [n]$:
  \begin{equation}
    d_X(Z(n_2), Z(n_1)) \leq \theta |n_2 - n_1|
  \end{equation}
  where $[n] := \{0, 1, \cdots, n\}$. An important special case is $n_2 = n_1 + 1$ for $n_1, n_2 \in [n]$ for which holds: $d_X(Z(n_1), Z(n_2)) \leq \theta$. This motivates a second
  definition if the discrete path namely as a sequence of points $(z_i)_{i=0}^n$ with $z_i \in X$ and for $\forall i \in \{0, 1, \cdots n-1\}$:
  \begin{equation}
    d_X(z_i, z_{i+1}) \leq \theta
  \end{equation}

  Let $m \in \N$ with $m \geq n$ and let $Z': [m] \to X$ be a discrete path. $Z'$ is called a \textbf{lazification} of $Z$ if there exists a surjective, monotone map 
  $f: [m] \to [n]$ such that $Z' = Z \circ f$.
\end{defin}

\begin{defin}
  Let $\theta \in \R_{>0}$, $n,m \in \N$ and let $Z_1: [n] \to X, Z_2: [n] \to X$ be two discrete $\theta$-paths in $X$. 
  A \textbf{(free) $\theta$-grid homotopy} is a $\theta$-lipschitz map $H: [n] \times [m] \to X$ such that:
  \begin{equation*}
    H(\cdot, 0) = Z_1 \: \land \: H(\cdot, m) = Z_2
  \end{equation*}
  where the product $[n] \times [m]$ is a metric space with the $\ell_1$ metric\footnote{i.e. for $x = (x_1, x_2), y = (y_1, y_2) \in [n] \times [m]: d_{\ell_1}(x, y) = |x_1 - y_1| + |x_2 - y_2|$}.

  A free $\theta$-grid homotopy is a $\theta$-grid homotopy if it preserves the endpoints of the discrete paths i.e.: $\forall t\in [m]$:
  \begin{equation*}
    H(0,t) = Z_1(0) = Z_2(0) \: \land \: H(n,t) = Z_1(n) = Z_2(n)
  \end{equation*}
  for paths $Z_1, Z_2$ with the same start and end points. 
\end{defin}

\begin{defin}
  Let $\theta \in \R_{>0}$ and let $Z_1, Z_2$ be discrete $\theta$-paths. $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are said to be $\theta$-homotopic 
  if there exist lazifications $Z_1'$ of $Z_1$ and $Z_2'$ of $Z_2$ with the same length and a $\theta$-grid homotopy between $Z_1'$ and $Z_2'$.
  
  This is denoted as $Z_1 \sim_{\theta} Z_2$.
\end{defin}

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:discrete-homotopy}
  Let $\theta \in \R_{>0}$ then the $\theta$-grid homotopy relation $\sim_{\theta}$ on the set $C(\mathcal{P}(\N), X)$ is a equivalence relation.
\end{lemma}

% TODO: look up proof in BCW14
\begin{proof}
  Similiar to proof of \ref{lem:homotopy-equivalence}.
\end{proof}

If there are two discrete paths $Z_1: [n] \to X$ and $Z_2: [m] \to X$ $(n,m \in \N)$ with $Z_1(n) = Z_2(0)$ 
then we can define the binary operation of path concatenation $*$ similiar to the continous case. This means that:
\begin{equation*}
  Z_1 * Z_2: [n + m] \to X, k \mapsto \begin{cases}
    Z_1(k), & k \in [n], \\
    Z_2(k - n), & k - n \in [m].
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
The neutral element of this operation is the constant path and for every discrete path there is the path $Z_1^{-}: [n] \to X, k \mapsto Z_1(n - k)$ 
which is the canonical inverse of $Z_1$.

\begin{defin}
  Let $\theta \in \R_{>0}$ and let $x_0 \in X$. With the previous discussion of $*$ in mind it is now possible to define the \textbf{discrete fundamental group} at scale $\theta$
  $\pi_{1,\theta}(X, x_0)$ as the set of $\theta$-homotopy classes\footnote{Equivalence classes of $\sim_{\theta}$} of closed paths starting and ending at $x_0$. 
  The group operation is the concatenation of discrete paths $*$.
  
  Because of lemma \ref{lem:discrete-homotopy} and the discussion preceding this definition $\pi_{1,\theta}(X, x_0)$ is a well-defined group.
\end{defin}
