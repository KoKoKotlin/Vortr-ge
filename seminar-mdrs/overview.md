## 1. Basic Definitions
 
 - Path
 - Semi-Locally Simple-Connectedness
 - Uniform Connectness
 - Uniform Pathconnectedness
 - Homotopy between Paths (free, endpoint preserving)
 - Fundamental group

## 2. Discretization of the Fundamental group
 
 - $\theta$-Lipschitz maps
 - Discrete Paths, Lazification
 - Discrete Homotopy of paths (free, endpoint preserving)
 - $\hat{\cdot}^{\theta}$ Discretization map for paths
 - Discretization of a homotopy yields a discrete homotopy between $\hat{H}^{\theta}(\cdot, 0)$ and $\hat{H}^{\theta}(\cdot, N)$
 - Discrete Fundamental group
 - $\hat{\cdot}^{\theta}: \pi_1(X, x_0) \to \pi_{1,\theta}(X, x_0)$ is a well-defined homomorphism

## 3. Inverse Limit

 - Categorical Definition of the Inverse Limit
 - Universal Property
 - $\hat{\cdot}$ is the unique homomorphism from $\pi_1(X, x_0)$ to $\varprojlim \pi_{1,\theta}(X, x_0)$
 - $\hat{\cdot}$ is an isomorphism if $X$ is uniformly locally path connected, uniformly semi-locally simply connected
 - $\hat{\cdot}$ is an isomorphism if $X$ is locally path connected, semi-locally simply connected and compact
 - Examples of spaces where $\hat{\cdot}$ is an isomorphism

## 4. Counterexamples

 - Counterexamples, $X$ is not compact
 - Counterexamples, $X$ is not locally path connected
 - Counterexamples, $X$ is not semi-locally simply connected
